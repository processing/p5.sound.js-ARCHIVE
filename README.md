## Scope of the project

This project is an update of the p5.sound.js library, with the following goals:

- Code stability and readability
- Updated and fewer dependencies
- Only keeping the most used features
- Deprecating the least used features

## Usage

To use this library, make sure you have p5.js installed. Visit the [p5.js website](https://p5js.org/) for more information and installation instructions.

Please let us know if you find any bugs or issues!
